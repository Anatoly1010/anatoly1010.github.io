abstract  ="Octahedral metal cluster complexes have high potential for biomedical applications. In order to evaluate the benefits of these moieties for combined CT/X-ray luminescence computed tomography{,} this paper compares photoluminescence{,} radiodensity and X-ray induced luminescence properties of eight related octahedral molybdenum and tungsten cluster complexes [{M6I8}L6]n (where M is Mo or W and L is I−{,} NO3−{,} OTs− or OH−/H2O). This article demonstrates that despite the fact that molybdenum cluster complexes are better photoluminescence emitters{,} tungsten cluster complexes{,} in particular (Bu4N)2[{W6I8}I6]{,} demonstrate significantly higher X-ray induced luminescence due to a combination of relatively good photoluminescence properties and high X-ray attenuation. Additionally{,} photo-degradation of [{M6I8}(NO3)6]2− was evaluated."}
