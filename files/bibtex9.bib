abstract={The development of quantum bits (qubits) is crucial for the progress of quantum technologies. Among various approaches, the qubits based on paramagnetic centers have decent advantages, including their diversity and possibilities of regular ordering, for example, within the structure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In the present work a simple and scalable approach to obtain qubit candidates based on stable organic radical 3-carboxy-proxyl and MOF-808 framework has been demonstrated. Investigation of the obtained compounds with different radical amounts using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) demonstrates the presence of two fractions of radicals, which is supported by simulations. Sufficiently long phase memory time at room temperature for the radicals adsorbed into MOF (0.39 $\mu$s), as well as the observed Rabi nutations, allow considering this material as a platform for qubits design. The developed approach is capable of incorporating various amounts of paramagnetic centers into the MOF structure and can be employed to obtain other spin qubit candidates.},
