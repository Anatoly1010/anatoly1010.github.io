abstract={The nature of the photoprocess for a Ni(Se2P(C6H5)2)2 = Ni(dsepi)2 complex in CCl4 and CH3CN has been determined by the EPR, steady-state and time-resolved optical spectroscopy methods. In both cases, the ultrafast relaxation of the excited state of Ni(dsepi)2 molecules are observed; however, the occurrence of a photochemical reaction, in addition to the above process, has been detected in CCl4 solutions. The photolysis mechanism of Ni(dsepi)2 includes the ClNi(dsepi)({\textbullet}dsepi) species formation stage initiated by electron transfer from the photoexcited complex to the halocarbon and subsequent fast reactions involving these intermediates. The final products of the photoreaction are the ((C6H5)2PSe)Se2 diselenide and the NiCl2 salt.},
