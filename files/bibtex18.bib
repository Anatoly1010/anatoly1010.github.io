ABSTRACT = {The Novosibirsk Free Electron Laser (NovoFEL) facility is able to produce high-power tunable terahertz (THz) laser radiation in quasi-continuous mode. The ability to control/shape this THz radiation is required in a number of user experiments. In this work we propose a modulation approach suitable for free electron lasers based on recuperation design. It allows for generating THz macropulses of a desirable length, down to several microseconds (limited by a quality factor of FEL optical resonator). Using this approach, macropulses in the time window from several microseconds to several hundred microseconds have been shown for three possible frequency ranges: mid-infrared (~1100 cm−1), far-infrared (~200 cm−1) and THz (~40 cm−1). In each case, the observed rise and decay of the macropulse have been measured and interpreted. The advantage of using short macropulses at the maximum peak power available has been demonstrated with the time-resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.},
