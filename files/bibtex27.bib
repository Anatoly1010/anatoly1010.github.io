abstract  ="X-irradiation of alkane solutions of N{,}N-dimethylaniline with various organic luminophores produces characteristic emission bands ascribed to the corresponding exciplexes. In contrast to optical generation{,} which requires diffusion-controlled quenching of excited states{,} an additional channel of exciplex formation via irreversible recombination of radical ion pairs is operative here{,} which produces exciplexes in solution with high efficiency even for p-terphenyl and diphenylacetylene having fluorescence decay times of 0.95 ns and 8 ps{,} respectively. The exciplex emission band is sensitive to an external magnetic field and exerts a very large observed magnetic field effect of up to 20%{,} the maximum possible value under the conditions of the described experiment."}
