abstract  ="The development of water-soluble hexanuclear cluster complexes of low toxicity is a promising task due to their potential biomedical applications such as bioimaging and photodynamic therapy. Herein{,} we present the syntheses of two new water-soluble hexarhenium cluster complexes with terminal amphiphilic phosphine ligands{,} and delineate their photoluminescence and X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) properties. These cluster complexes{,} namely [{Re6Q8}(PPh2CH2CH2COO)6]4− (Q = S (1); Se{,} (2)){,} have the least cytotoxicity among all the tested hexanuclear metal-clusters{,} are capable of penetrating into cells and exhibit moderate photodynamic toxicity toward Hep-2 cells."}
