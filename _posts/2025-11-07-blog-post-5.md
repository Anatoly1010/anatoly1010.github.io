Our article, "Atomize: A Modular Software for Control and Automation of Scientific and Industrial Instruments" was published online today, 07-11-2025, in Journal of Open Research Software. <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/jors.594">Check it out</a>.<br/>
Atomize is a modular software designed to control a wide range of scientific and industrial instruments, integrate them into a unified multifunctional setup, and automate routine experimental work. The software consists of a collection of Python libraries for different apparatus and general-purpose functions, including user-friendly functions for data visualization and storage. All of this, combined with a graphical user interface and the possibility of performing test runs to check the logic of the experiment without access to the devices used, provides a high degree of flexibility and usability, even without significant programming experience. Atomize is freely available on GitHub, and we encourage researchers, engineers, students, and developers working in any field of science and technology to use it in their work.
