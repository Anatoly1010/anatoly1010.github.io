The intracomplex reaction of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) in triplet excited state (<sup>3</sup>AQDS) with beta-cyclodextrin (CD) and the reaction of <sup>3</sup>AQDS:CD complex with external quencher, N-Acetyl-l-Tyrosine (TyrO−), have been studied using laser flash photolysis, <sup>1</sup>H NMR and <sup>1</sup>H CIDNP. The two reactions were found to be competing with each other. The intracomplex hydrogen abstraction previously proposed for <sup>3</sup>AQDS:CD complex may represent a two-step process, where at first stage an electron is transferred from the -OH group of CD to <sup>3</sup>AQDS followed by a proton transfer and recombination of AQDS and CD radicals resulting in a stable AQDS-CD product. The rate constant of the intracomplex electron transfer from CD to <sup>3</sup>AQDS was found to be 6±1x10<sup>6</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> and the rate of subsequent proton transfer is 1±0.1x10<sup>6</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. The rate constant of electron transfer between TyrO− and <sup>3</sup>AQDS:CD complex (0.4±0.1x10<sup>9</sup>M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) drops approx. by half compared to that in the reaction between TyrO− and free <sup>3</sup>AQDS (0.8±0.1x10<sup>9</sup>M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>).
