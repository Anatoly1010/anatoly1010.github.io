The X-band Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy endstation at the Novosibirsk Free Electron Laser (NovoFEL) facility is capable for steady-state (CW) EPR and time-resolved (TR) continuous wave EPR experiments. Recently several upgrades in experimental hardware and software have been done, aiming to more productively use the time of experimental session and to increase the control of experimental parameters during the session. Firstly, we installed detectors with different time resolution for tracking radiation produced by NovoFEL. Secondly, on the basic of fsc2 program, we implemented a possibility of a simultaneous use of two oscilloscopes, configured at different timescale and/or sensitivity. Finally, we developed software for on-the-fly CW and TR experimental data viewing and treatment.
