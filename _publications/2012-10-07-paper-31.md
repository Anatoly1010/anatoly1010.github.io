A novel spectrometer for low-field studies in magnetically affected reaction yield (MARY) spectroscopy with fluorescence detection is described. The spectrometer is based on a yoke-free magnetic system containing no ferromagnetic elements, uses X-ray or optical excitation, and includes a monochromator to analyze the spectral composition of luminescence. Using the new setup, the effect of transversal residual magnetic field on zero field MARY line is illustrated, formation of exciplexes under X-irradiation in a naphthalene/N,N-dimethylaniline solution in alkane is demonstrated, a magnetic field effect on the emission spectrum is shown in field-cycling mode, and modulated MARY spectra in the exciplex and the intrinsic luminophor bands are compared to show that magnetic field sensitivity here is provided at the stage of the recombining radical ion pair, while exciplex formation only transforms the luminescence properties.
