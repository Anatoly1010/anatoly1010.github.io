Formation and recombination of transient radical anions of Al, Ga, and In tris-8-oxyquinolinates (Alq<sub>3</sub>, Gaq<sub>3</sub>, and Inq<sub>3</sub>), the key species in certain organic electroluminescing devices, was studied in X-irradiated benzene solution. The spectra of recombination luminescence were obtained and effective yields of recombination luminescence referred to Alq<sub>3</sub> were estimated as 0.3 (Gaq<sub>3</sub>) and 0.15 (Inq<sub>3</sub>). Magnetic field effects in recombination luminescence involving the radical anions of the three oxyquinolinates were obtained, from which hyperfine coupling constants at the central ions were estimated as 0.45 (I<sub>Al</sub> = 5/2), 0.8 (I<sub>Ga</sub> = 3/2), and 0.6 (I<sub>In</sub> = 9/2) mT for radical anions of Alq<sub>3</sub>, Gaq<sub>3</sub>, and Inq<sub>3</sub>, respectively.
