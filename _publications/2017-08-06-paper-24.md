Octahedral metal cluster complexes have high potential for biomedical applications. In order to evaluate the benefits of these moieties for combined CT/X-ray luminescence computed tomography, this paper compares photoluminescence, radiodensity and X-ray induced luminescence properties of eight related octahedral molybdenum and tungsten cluster complexes [{M<sub>6</sub>I<sub>8</sub>}L<sub>6</sub>]<sup>n</sup> (where M is Mo or W and L is I<sup>−</sup>, NO<sup>3−</sup>, OTs<sup>−</sup> or OH<sup>−</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>O). This article demonstrates that despite the fact that molybdenum cluster complexes are better photoluminescence emitters, tungsten cluster complexes, in particular (Bu<sub>4</sub>N)<sub>2</sub>[{W<sub>6</sub>I<sub>8</sub>}I<sub>6</sub>], demonstrate significantly higher X-ray induced luminescence due to a combination of relatively good photoluminescence properties and high X-ray attenuation. Additionally, photo-degradation of [{M<sub>6</sub>I<sub>8</sub>}(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2−</sup> was evaluated.
