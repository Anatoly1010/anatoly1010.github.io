The nature of the photoprocess for a Ni(Se<sub>2</sub>P(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = Ni(dsepi)<sub>2</sub> complex in CCl<sub>4</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>CN has been determined by the EPR, steady-state and time-resolved optical spectroscopy methods. In both cases, the ultrafast relaxation of the excited state of Ni(dsepi)<sub>2</sub> molecules are observed; however, the occurrence of a photochemical reaction, in addition to the above process, has been detected in CCl<sub>4</sub> solutions. The photolysis mechanism of Ni(dsepi)<sub>2</sub> includes the ClNi(dsepi)(-dsepi) species formation stage initiated by electron transfer from the photoexcited complex to the halocarbon and subsequent fast reactions involving these intermediates. The final products of the photoreaction are the ((C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PSe)Se<sub>2</sub> diselenide and the NiCl<sub>2</sub> salt.
